**AirShell** is a bash script that allows you to customise your terminal prompt (known as __`ps1`__).
With it you can make the prompt not only cleaner, but also have useful dynamic widgets shown with your prompt.
An example prompt may look as follows:

<div class="text-center">
<img src="assets/img/prompt.png" alt="Prompt example" />
<br/>
<br/>
<img src="assets/img/prompt2.png" alt="Prompt example" />
<br/>
<small>(both are using default theme)</small>
</div>
